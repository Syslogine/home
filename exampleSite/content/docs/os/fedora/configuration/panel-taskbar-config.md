## GNOME Desktop Environment

GNOME is the default desktop environment in Fedora Workstation. It comes with a top panel (also known as the "top bar") and an optional dock (called the "dash") on the left side of the screen.

### Top Panel Configuration

1. **Right-click** on the top panel and select **"Preferences"** or **"Tweak Tool"**.
2. In the **"Top Bar"** section, you can customize various aspects of the panel, such as:
   - Changing the panel location (top, bottom, left, or right)
   - Adjusting the panel size and auto-hide behavior
   - Enabling or disabling the date, week numbers, and battery percentage displays
   - Configuring the clock format and calendar preferences
   - Adding or removing panel applets (e.g., volume control, network indicator, etc.)

3. You can also access advanced panel settings by installing the `gnome-tweaks` package:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks
   ```

   The GNOME Tweaks tool provides additional options for panel customization, such as changing the panel theme, adjusting transparency levels, and enabling desktop icons.

### Dash (Dock) Configuration

1. **Right-click** on the dash (dock) and select **"Dash to Dock Settings"**.
2. In the settings window, you can customize various aspects of the dash, such as:
   - Changing the dash position (left, right, top, or bottom)
   - Adjusting the dash size, icon size, and icon spacing
   - Enabling or disabling dash auto-hiding behavior
   - Configuring dash appearance (opaque, transparent, or customized)
   - Adding or removing dash extensions (e.g., window previews, app shortcuts, etc.)

## KDE Plasma Desktop Environment

KDE Plasma provides a highly customizable desktop experience, including extensive panel and taskbar configuration options.

1. **Right-click** on the panel (taskbar) and select **"Enter Edit Mode"**.
2. Once in edit mode, you can:
   - Add or remove panel widgets (such as system tray, clock, launcher, etc.)
   - Adjust the panel size, position, and orientation
   - Configure panel behavior (auto-hide, visibility settings, etc.)
   - Customize the panel appearance (theme, transparency, background, etc.)

3. For more advanced settings, open the **"System Settings"** utility from the application menu or by pressing `Alt + F3`.
4. Navigate to **"Workspace Behavior"** > **"Desktop Behavior"** to access additional taskbar and panel configuration options, such as:
   - Configuring taskbar and panel settings (e.g., task grouping, app launchers, etc.)
   - Adjusting panel and taskbar animations and visual effects
   - Enabling or disabling desktop widgets and system tray icons

## Xfce Desktop Environment

Xfce is a lightweight and highly configurable desktop environment with a panel (taskbar) at the top or bottom of the screen.

1. **Right-click** on the panel and select **"Panel"** > **"Panel Preferences"**.
2. In the **"Panel Preferences"** window, you can customize various aspects of the panel, such as:
   - Adjusting the panel size, length, and position
   - Configuring panel appearance (background, colors, transparency, etc.)
   - Adding or removing panel items (launchers, applets, separators, etc.)
   - Enabling or disabling panel auto-hide behavior

3. For more advanced settings, open the **"Window Manager"** application from the application menu or by pressing `Alt + F3`.
4. Navigate to **"Window Manager Tweaks"** > **"Workspaces"** to access additional taskbar and panel configuration options, such as:
   - Configuring taskbar behavior (task grouping, button styles, etc.)
   - Adjusting panel and taskbar animations and visual effects
   - Enabling or disabling desktop icons and system tray icons

By following these steps, you can customize your Fedora Linux panels and taskbars to suit your workflow and preferences, optimizing your workspace organization across different desktop environments.
