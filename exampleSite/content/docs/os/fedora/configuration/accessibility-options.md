## Visual Accessibility

### High Contrast Theme

Fedora offers a high contrast theme that enhances visibility by increasing the contrast between text and background colors. This feature is particularly helpful for users with low vision or certain visual impairments.

To enable the high contrast theme:

1. Click on the "Activities" overview button (the top-left icon on the desktop).
2. Search for and open the "Settings" application.
3. Navigate to the "Universal Access" section.
4. Under the "Vision" tab, toggle the "High Contrast" option to enable it.

### Screen Reader

Fedora includes Orca, a powerful screen reader that provides spoken and braille feedback to users with visual impairments. Orca can read aloud the contents of the screen, including text, menus, and dialogues.

To enable the screen reader:

1. Open the "Settings" application.
2. Navigate to the "Universal Access" section.
3. Under the "Vision" tab, toggle the "Screen Reader" option to enable Orca.
4. You can further customize Orca's settings by clicking on the "Settings" button next to the "Screen Reader" option.

### Text-to-Speech

Fedora offers text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, which can read aloud text from documents, web pages, or other applications. This feature is particularly useful for users with visual impairments or reading difficulties.

To enable text-to-speech:

1. Open the "Settings" application.
2. Navigate to the "Universal Access" section.
3. Under the "Speech" tab, toggle the "Text-to-Speech" option to enable it.
4. You can configure various settings, such as the voice, rate, and pitch, by clicking on the "Settings" button next to the "Text-to-Speech" option.

### Zoom

Fedora provides a zoom feature that allows users to magnify the entire screen or a specific area. This can be beneficial for users with low vision or those who require a larger on-screen display.

To enable the zoom feature:

1. Open the "Settings" application.
2. Navigate to the "Universal Access" section.
3. Under the "Vision" tab, toggle the "Zoom" option to enable it.
4. You can customize the zoom settings, such as the magnification level and zoom behavior, by clicking on the "Settings" button next to the "Zoom" option.

## Auditory Accessibility

### Visual Alerts

Fedora offers visual alerts as an alternative to auditory alerts for users with hearing impairments. This feature provides visual cues, such as flashing the screen or displaying a notification, instead of playing sound alerts.

To enable visual alerts:

1. Open the "Settings" application.
2. Navigate to the "Universal Access" section.
3. Under the "Hearing" tab, toggle the "Visual Alerts" option to enable it.

### Closed Captions

Fedora supports closed captions for multimedia content, which displays text transcriptions of audio or dialogue. This feature is particularly useful for users with hearing impairments or those who prefer to follow along with on-screen text.

To enable closed captions:

1. Open the multimedia application (e.g., Videos, Web Browser, etc.).
2. Look for the closed caption or subtitle settings within the application's preferences or playback controls.
3. Enable closed captions and select the desired language or style.

## Mobility Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation

Fedora provides robust keyboard navigation capabilities, allowing users to control the desktop environment and applications using keyboard shortcuts and commands. This feature is beneficial for users with mobility impairments or those who prefer to minimize mouse usage.

To enable keyboard navigation:

1. Open the "Settings" application.
2. Navigate to the "Universal Access" section.
3. Under the "Typing" tab, toggle the "Keyboard Navigation" option to enable it.
4. You can further customize keyboard navigation settings, such as key repeat rate and delay, by clicking on the "Settings" button next to the "Keyboard Navigation" option.

### Sticky Keys

The sticky keys feature allows users to press modifier keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt, Shift) and other keys separately, rather than simultaneously. This can be helpful for users with mobility impairments or those who find it difficult to press multiple keys at once.

To enable sticky keys:

1. Open the "Settings" application.
2. Navigate to the "Universal Access" section.
3. Under the "Typing" tab, toggle the "Sticky Keys" option to enable it.

### Mouse Keys

Fedora's mouse keys feature allows users to control the mouse pointer using the numeric keypad on the keyboard. This can be beneficial for users who have difficulty using a physical mouse or trackpad.

To enable mouse keys:

1. Open the "Settings" application.
2. Navigate to the "Universal Access" section.
3. Under the "Pointing & Clicking" tab, toggle the "Mouse Keys" option to enable it.
4. You can further customize mouse keys settings, such as the pointer speed and acceleration, by clicking on the "Settings" button next to the "Mouse Keys" option.
