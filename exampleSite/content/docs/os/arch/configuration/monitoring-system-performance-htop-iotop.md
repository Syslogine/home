## 1. Introduction
Effective system monitoring is crucial for maintaining optimal performance in Arch Linux. This guide will teach you how to use htop and iotop to monitor and analyze system resources.

## 2. Installing htop and iotop
Install these tools using pacman:
```bash
sudo pacman -S htop iotop
```
Explain any dependencies or optional features.

## 3. Understanding htop

### Basic htop Interface
Describe the htop interface:
```bash
htop
```
Explain the main sections: header, process list, and footer.

### Interpreting htop Output
Detail key metrics:
- CPU usage bars
- Memory and swap usage
- Load average
- Uptime and tasks

### Navigating in htop
Demonstrate navigation commands:
- F5 to toggle tree view
- F6 for sorting options
- Up/down arrows for process selection

## 4. Advanced htop Features

### Sorting and Filtering
Show how to sort processes:
- By CPU usage: P
- By memory usage: M
- By process ID: I

Demonstrate filtering:
```
F4 (to enter filter mode)
```

### Process Management
Explain process management capabilities:
- K to kill a process
- N to change process priority (nice)
- S to trace system calls

### Customizing htop Display
Guide through customization:
- F2 to access setup menu
- Adding/removing columns
- Changing color scheme

## 5. Using iotop for I/O Monitoring

### Basic iotop Interface
Introduce the iotop interface:
```bash
sudo iotop
```
Explain why root privileges are needed.

### Interpreting iotop Output
Describe key metrics:
- Total DISK READ/WRITE
- Current DISK READ/WRITE
- SWAPIN and IO>

### iotop Command Options
Demonstrate useful options:
```bash
sudo iotop -o  # Only show processes doing I/O
sudo iotop -b  # Run in batch mode
```

## 6. Combining htop and iotop for Comprehensive Monitoring
Suggest strategies for using both tools effectively:
- Running them in separate terminal windows
- Using tmux or screen for split-screen monitoring

## 7. Best Practices for System Monitoring
Provide tips for effective monitoring:
- Regular check-ups vs. continuous monitoring
- Identifying baseline performance
- Setting up alerts for abnormal activity

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Performance Issues
Guide through diagnosing common problems:
- High CPU usage
- Memory leaks
- I/O bottlenecks
- Runaway processes

## 9. Automating Performance Monitoring
Introduce methods for automated monitoring:
- Using cron jobs with htop and iotop in batch mode
- Integrating with monitoring systems like Nagios or Zabbix

## 10. Conclusion
Summarize the importance of system monitoring and the roles of htop and iotop in maintaining a healthy Arch Linux system. Encourage further exploration of system monitoring techniques and tools.
