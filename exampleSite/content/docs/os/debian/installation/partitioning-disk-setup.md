## Introduction

Partitioning your hard drive and configuring disk setup are essential steps during the Debian installation process. This tutorial provides guidance on partition types, sizes, and mount points to help you effectively partition your hard drive for Debian installation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Booted into the Debian installer environment
- Backed up any important data on your hard drive

## Step 1: Launch the Installer

1. Boot your computer from the Debian installation media (USB drive, DVD, etc.).
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to access the Debian installer environment.

## Step 2: Choose Installation Type

1. Select "Graphical Install" or "Install" from the Debian installer menu to begin the installation process.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed to the partitioning step.

## Step 3: Partitioning Scheme

1. Choose the manual partitioning option when prompted.
2. Review your hard drive's current partition layout and select the disk to partition.

## Step 4: Create Partitions

1. Select "New Partition Table" if you're starting with a clean disk, or choose "Add Partition" if partitions already exist.
2. Create partitions for the root filesystem (/), swap space, and any additional partitions as needed (e.g., /home, /boot).
3. Set the partition type, size, and mount point for each partition.

## Step 5: Configure Filesystems

1. Choose the filesystem type for each partition (e.g., ext4 for the root filesystem).
2. Specify any additional options or parameters for each filesystem.

## Step 6: Finalize Partitioning

1. Review the partition layout and configurations to ensure they meet your needs.
2. Confirm the changes and proceed with the installation process.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively partition your hard drive and configure disk setup during the Debian installation process. Proper partitioning ensures optimal performance, storage management, and system stability for your Debian system.
