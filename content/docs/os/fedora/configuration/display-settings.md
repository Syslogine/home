### Accessing Display Settings

1. Click on the "Activities" overview button at the top-left corner of your desktop.
2. Type "Settings" in the search bar and open the "Settings" application.
3. In the "Settings" window, click on the "Displays" option.

### Adjusting Display Resolution

1. In the "Displays" settings, you will see a list of available displays connected to your system.
2. Click on the display you want to adjust.
3. Under the "Resolution" dropdown menu, select your desired resolution.
4. The display will automatically apply the new resolution.

### Adjusting Display Scaling

Display scaling is useful when you have a high-resolution display or want to adjust the size of user interface elements.

1. In the "Displays" settings, click on the display you want to adjust.
2. Locate the "Scale" section and use the slider to increase or decrease the scaling factor.
3. Higher scaling factors will make everything appear larger, while lower scaling factors will make things appear smaller.

### Rotating the Display

If you need to rotate your display for a specific use case or physical orientation, follow these steps:

1. In the "Displays" settings, click on the display you want to rotate.
2. Click on the "Rotation" dropdown menu and select the desired rotation (Normal, 90°, 180°, 270°).
3. The display will rotate accordingly.

### Adjusting Refresh Rate

A higher refresh rate can provide a smoother visual experience, especially for gaming or video playback.

1. In the "Displays" settings, click on the display you want to adjust.
2. Under the "Refresh Rate" dropdown menu, select the desired refresh rate.
3. Note that available refresh rates depend on your monitor's capabilities and the maximum supported by your graphics hardware.

## Multi-Monitor Setup

Fedora Linux supports multiple monitors out of the box, allowing you to extend or mirror your desktop across multiple displays.

### Enabling Multiple Monitors

1. Connect the additional monitors to your computer's video output ports (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, etc.).
2. Open the "Displays" settings as described earlier.
3. The additional monitors should appear in the "Displays" list.

### Extending the Desktop

Extending the desktop allows you to treat multiple monitors as a single, larger workspace.

1. In the "Displays" settings, make sure both monitors are detected and listed.
2. Click on the primary display (usually the one with the menu bar).
3. Check the "Extend desktop to this display" option.
4. Adjust the display layout by dragging and positioning the monitor icons according to your physical setup.

### Mirroring the Desktop

Mirroring the desktop duplicates the same content across all connected displays.

1. In the "Displays" settings, make sure both monitors are detected and listed.
2. Click on the primary display.
3. Check the "Mirror display" option.
4. All connected displays will now show the same content.

### Display Arrangement

If your multi-monitor setup doesn't match the physical arrangement, you can rearrange the display layout.

1. In the "Displays" settings, click and drag the monitor icons to match their physical positions.
2. You can also use the "Join Displays" option to combine multiple displays into a single larger workspace.

### Display Profiles

Fedora Linux allows you to save and load display configurations as profiles, making it easier to switch between different setups.

1. In the "Displays" settings, configure your desired multi-monitor setup.
2. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the window.
3. Give your profile a name and click "Save" again.
4. To load a saved profile, click on the profile name in the "Displays" settings.

By following this comprehensive tutorial, you should now be able to adjust display settings, configure multi-monitor setups, and optimize your workspace according to your preferences in Fedora Linux.
