Keyboard shortcuts are powerful tools for streamlining workflow and improving productivity in Debian. By assigning shortcuts for common tasks such as launching applications, navigating windows, and performing system actions, you can perform tasks more efficiently. This tutorial provides instructions for customizing keyboard shortcuts in Debian to suit your workflow and preferences.
