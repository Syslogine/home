## Introduction

Web development tools and frameworks are essential for building modern web applications. This tutorial provides an overview of popular web development tools and frameworks available on Debian systems, along with installation instructions and setup guides.

## Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to build server-side and networking applications. Here's how to install Node.js on Debian:

### Installation

1. Update package repository:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

3. Verify the installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Getting Started

Once Node.js is installed, you can start building applications using frameworks like Express.js, Vue.js, or React.

## Angular

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a popular JavaScript framework for building single-page web applications. Here's how to install Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) on Debian:

### Installation

1. Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed).

2. Install Angular CLI globally:

```bash
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
```

3. Verify the installation:

```bash
ng --version
```

### Getting Started

With Angular CLI installed, you can create and scaffold Angular projects easily:

```bash
ng new my-angular-app
cd my-angular-app
ng serve
```

## React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Here's how to install React using npm on Debian:

### Installation

1. Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed).

2. Create a new React app:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Conclusion

Web development tools and frameworks like Node.js, Angular, and React offer powerful capabilities for building modern web applications. By following the installation instructions and setup guides provided in this tutorial, developers can quickly set up their development environments and start building robust web applications on Debian systems.
