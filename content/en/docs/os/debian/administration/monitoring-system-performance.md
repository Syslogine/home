## Introduction

Monitoring system performance is crucial for ensuring the smooth operation and stability of Debian systems. By tracking resource usage such as CPU, memory, disk, and network, administrators can identify bottlenecks, troubleshoot issues, and optimize system performance. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on monitoring system performance using tools like `top`, `htop`, and `nmon` in Debian.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Access to a Debian system with administrative privileges
- Basic understanding of the command line interface

## Step 1: Using `top`

`top` is a command-line utility that provides real-time information about system resource usage. To launch `top`, open a terminal and simply type:

```bash
top
```

This will display a dynamic view of system processes, CPU usage, memory usage, and other system metrics. Press `q` to exit `top`.

## Step 2: Using `htop`

`htop` is an interactive process viewer that offers more features and a user-friendly interface compared to `top`. To install `htop`, run:

```bash
sudo apt install htop
```

Once installed, launch `htop` by typing:

```bash
htop
```

`htop` provides a color-coded display of system resources and allows you to interactively manage processes. Press `q` to exit `htop`.

## Step 3: Using `nmon`

`nmon` (short for Nigel's Monitor) is another powerful command-line tool for monitoring system performance. To install `nmon`, run:

```bash
sudo apt install nmon
```

To launch `nmon`, simply type:

```bash
nmon
```

`nmon` provides detailed information on CPU, memory, disk, and network usage in a concise and easy-to-read format. Press `q` to exit `nmon`.

## Conclusion

Monitoring system performance is essential for maintaining the health and efficiency of Debian systems. By using tools like `top`, `htop`, and `nmon`, administrators can gain valuable insights into system resource usage and take proactive measures to optimize performance and troubleshoot issues as needed.
