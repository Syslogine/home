## Changing the Desktop Wallpaper

Fedora comes with a collection of pre-installed wallpapers, and you can also use your own images as wallpapers. Here's how you can change the desktop wallpaper:

1. Right-click on the desktop and select "Change Desktop Background" or "Change Wallpaper" (depending on your desktop environment).

2. The "Background Preferences" or "Wallpaper Preferences" window will appear, providing you with different options to choose and configure your wallpaper.

3. In the "Background" tab, you can select from various pre-installed wallpapers by clicking on the thumbnails or by navigating through the directories in the left pane.

4. If you want to use your own image as a wallpaper, click on the "+" button at the bottom of the window and select your desired image file.

5. The selected image will be added to the list of available wallpapers. You can preview it by clicking on the thumbnail.

6. Adjust the wallpaper settings according to your preferences. You can choose to fill the screen, center the image, stretch it, or set it to span across multiple displays if you have a multi-monitor setup.

7. You can also configure the wallpaper to change at specific intervals by selecting the "Change Background" option in the "Background" tab and specifying the desired interval.

8. Once you're satisfied with your choices, click "Close" or "Apply" to save the changes and apply the new wallpaper.

## Configuring the Screensaver

Screensavers are designed to protect your display from burn-in and add a touch of personalization to your desktop. Here's how you can configure the screensaver settings in Fedora:

1. Open the "Settings" application or right-click on the desktop and select "Settings" or "Preferences."

2. In the "Settings" window, navigate to the "Screensaver" or "Power Management" section.

3. Here, you can choose a screensaver from the list of available options. Fedora provides several built-in screensavers, ranging from simple blank screens to animated graphics and photos.

4. After selecting a screensaver, you can customize its settings by clicking on the "Preferences" or "Settings" button next to it.

5. Adjust the screensaver's properties, such as the delay before activation, the behavior when the screensaver is running (e.g., locking the screen or requiring a password to dismiss it), and any other specific settings for the chosen screensaver.

6. Some screensavers may offer additional options, like displaying random images from a folder or adjusting the animation speed.

7. You can also configure the power management settings in the same section, which control the behavior of your display and system when it is idle or inactive for a certain period.

8. Once you've made your desired changes, click "Close" or "Apply" to save the settings.

## Additional Tips and Tricks

- You can use online resources or dedicated wallpaper websites to find and download high-quality wallpapers for your desktop.

- If you have a multi-monitor setup, you can set different wallpapers for each display by selecting the appropriate display in the wallpaper preferences window.

- Some desktop environments, like GNOME, offer additional extensions or plugins that provide more advanced wallpaper and screensaver customization options. You can explore these extensions from the respective extension repositories.

- Fedora also supports live wallpapers, which are animated or interactive wallpapers. You can find and install live wallpaper packages from the Fedora repositories or third-party sources.

- If you prefer a minimalist approach, you can choose a solid color or a simple pattern as your wallpaper by selecting the appropriate option in the wallpaper preferences window.

Customizing your desktop environment with personalized wallpapers and screensavers is a great way to make your Fedora experience more visually appealing and tailored to your preferences. Experiment with different options and find the combination that suits your style and needs best.
