Fedora Linux ships with the GNOME desktop environment by default, which offers a modern and sleek user interface. However, you may want to personalize the look and feel of your desktop to suit your taste or increase productivity. Fortunately, GNOME provides various tools and utilities to customize the system theme, icons, fonts, and other visual elements.

## Changing the System Theme

3. Once you've made your selection, click "Set Background" to apply the changes.

## Customizing the Login Screen

The login screen is the first thing you see when you start your Fedora Linux system. You can customize the login screen to match your system's theme or personal preferences.

1. Open the "Settings" application and navigate to "Users".
2. Under the "Users" section, click on the "Unlock" button and enter your password to make changes.
3. Click on the user account you want to customize.

## Installing Third-Party Themes

While Fedora Linux comes with a decent selection of themes and icons, you can further enhance your desktop's appearance by installing third-party themes from various sources.

1. Open the "Software" application (or your preferred package manager).
2. Search for "gnome-shell-extensions" or "gnome-tweaks" and install the corresponding package.
3. After installation, open the "Extensions" application (you can search for it in the "Activities" overview).
4. Browse and install the desired extensions or themes from the available options.
5. Some popular third-party theme sources include:
   - [Gnome-Look.org](https://www.gnome-look.org/) - A vast collection of GNOME themes, icons, and extensions.
   - [Pling.com](https://www.pling.com/) - Another excellent source for GNOME-related customizations.

## Using the Gnome Tweaks Tool

The Gnome Tweaks Tool is a powerful utility that provides advanced customization options for the GNOME desktop environment. It allows you to tweak various aspects of your desktop, including the appearance, behavior, and functionality.

1. Install the "Gnome Tweaks" package from the Software application or your preferred package manager.
2. Once installed, open the "Tweaks" application (you can search for it in the "Activities" overview).
3. The Tweaks application is divided into several sections, each offering different customization options:
   - "Appearance": Customize the desktop theme, icons, cursors, and more.
   - "Desktop": Adjust desktop icons, font rendering, and other desktop-related settings.
   - "Top Bar": Customize the top bar (panel) appearance and behavior.
   - "Windows": Modify window behavior, such as focus mode, titlebar buttons, and more.
   - "Extensions": Enable or disable GNOME Shell extensions.

Explore the various options available in the Tweaks application and make adjustments to suit your preferences.

## Restoring Default Settings

If you've made too many customizations and want to revert to the default system theme and settings, you can easily do so by following these steps:

1. Open the "Settings" application and navigate to "Appearance".
2. Under the "Themes" section, click on the drop-down menu and select the default system theme (usually named "Adwaita").
3. Repeat the same process for the "Icons" section and select the default icon theme.
4. Navigate to the "Fonts" section and reset the font settings to their defaults.
5. Right-click on the desktop and select "Change Desktop Background".
6. In the "Background" window, click on the "Reset" button to restore the default desktop background.
